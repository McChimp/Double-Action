# Double-Action
Double Action v.1 authored by McChimp (helped by Atagait), 06 / 06 / 2018.  Multiple trigger raid manager.

FOR WINDOWS ONLY.

You MUST NOT use more than one Double Action window or use it simultaneously with any other tools. Doing so breaks the NS terms of use. The program will get stuck if one of your triggers does not update when anticipated or has already updated. As such, it is advised you be prepared to trigger manually.

To use it, run the exe file available for download.

The program periodically queries the NS API, retrieving a page displaying your trigger's influence and informing you when this has changed.
